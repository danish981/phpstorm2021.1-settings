Smart auto-save will keep your content both in the editor and on the mainframe in-sync.</li>\n  <li>Create multiple connections to different z/OS systems.</li>\n  <li>Perform all available operations with Jobs.</li>\n  <li>Highlight all IntelliJ supported languages automatically and recognize them once opened from the mainframe.</li>\n</ul><br>\nTo start using the plugin:<br>\n<ul>\n  <li>Install the plugin in your Intellij based IDE.</li>\n  <li>Contact your RACF administrator so that your user is in the <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.4.0?topic=guide-security-structures-zosmf\">IZUUSER  RACF group</a></li>\n  <li>You are ready to go!
